Run benchmarking workloads to measure the cloud noise. It is then fed to the
BOE as the Îµ_c parameter. Lightweight, only need to run it every few hours with
a few instances.

As we do not use an actual cloud in this implementation, a value from the
Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 is returned.
